'Sorry to interrupt,' Daniel said.'But Lisa needs to talk to you, Mr. Reed. About the complaints from three women in the office. About how you talk to them. How you make them feel small.' Mr. Reed's face went white. 'What? That's ridiculous!'",
                            "paragraph3": "Lisa stepped forward. 'We have the emails you sent them, Mr. Reed. And Maya isn't the only one you've tried to control.' Later, in the break room, Maya sat with Daniel and three other women from the office. They all had stories like Maya's. Mr. Reed had told them they were too emotional, too weak, not good enough. He had made them doubt themselves.",
                            "paragraph4": "'I thought it was just me,' said one woman named Teresa. 'I thought something was wrong with me.' 'Me too,' said Maya. 'For a long time, I believed him.' That evening, Maya called her mother. She had something important to ask. 'Mom,' she said, 'was I a happy child? Before dad left?'",
                            "paragraph5": "Her mother was quiet for a moment. 'Yes, Maya. You were so full of joy. You laughed all the time.' 'And then I became serious. Strong.' 'You became what we needed,' her mother said softly. 'You became our rock. I'm sorry, Maya. It was too much for a child.'"

                            "paragraph2": "Three months later, Maya sat in a new office. After what happened with Mr. Reed, she had found a better job. One where she could be herself. On her desk was the plant from Daniel, now three times bigger. Next to it was a photo of Maya with her mother and brother, all smiling. And a new picture: Maya and Daniel at the beach, laughing.",
                            "paragraph3": "Maya's phone rang. It was a young woman from her old office named Sara. 'Can we meet for coffee?' Sara asked. 'I'm struggling with... with feeling like I need to be perfect all the time.' Maya smiled. 'Yes. I know exactly how that feels.'",
                            "paragraph4": "As she put down the phone, Maya caught her reflection in her computer screen. The face looking back was still strong. But not hard anymore. Not perfect. Just real. That night, as she watered her growing plant, Maya thought about the little girl she once was. The girl who built walls around her heart to stay safe.",

Maya touched the soft new leaves on her plant. Steel can't grow. Steel can't change. Steel can't love. But hearts can."
